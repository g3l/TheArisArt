Website developed by Godfrey Lemi

All artwork used on the website created by Aris Bobwa

Looked at some examples on w3schools for help, although i've made them my own
 the things to do with flexbox and the javascript for the 1 page webiste are the main features i used as inspiration.

 used the validator a lot to make sure there were no errors in my code.
