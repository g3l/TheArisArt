Website developed by Godfrey Lemi

All artwork used on the website created by Aris Bobwa

Looked at some examples on w3schools for help, although i've made them my own
 the things to do with flexbox and the javascript for the 1 page webiste are the main features i used as inspiration.

 used the validator a lot to make sure there were no errors in my code.

 the idea of the website came when i saw my friends art work and decide to give him a platform to showcase his work.

 looked at similar websites for inspiration to see what features they have in common. the one website i liked was; https://www.liambrazier.com/   i just thought the layout was cool and wanted something similar
 
 I can't remember where i got the idea for the javascript form but its not 100% mine. i've made it my own to suit what i had in mind.
 
Form; on submit, the form does not save or email the filled in form. i'm still trying to figure a way to get the form to be emailed to myself
